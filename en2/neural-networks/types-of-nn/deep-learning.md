• Neural Networks (NN): Inspired by the human brain, neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). These networks are used for tasks like image and speech recognition.

• Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Specialized for image data, CNNs automatically detect and learn features like edges, textures, and objects.

• Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Used for sequential data, such as time series or natural language. RNNs can maintain information across time steps.

• Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Consist of two networks (generator and discriminator) competing against each other to create realistic synthetic data.
