# Local Search

#### **Local Search Algorithm**

* **Definition**: Local search algorithms operate on a single state (or a small set of states) and explore the space incrementally, typically aiming to improve the current state. Examples include hill climbing and simulated annealing.
* **Relation to MEA**: **Means-Ends Analysis** does not fit this definition because it is not about optimizing states incrementally in a local space. Instead, MEA reduces the difference between the current state and the goal state by breaking the problem into smaller subproblems.
