### Comparison of Uninformed and Informed Search Algorithms  <a href="#comparison-of-uninformed-and-informed-search-algorithms" id="comparison-of-uninformed-and-informed-search-algorithms"></a>

| Feature            | Uninformed Search     | Informed Search            |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Knowledge Required | None                  | Domain-specific heuristics |
| Efficiency         | Lower                 | Higher                     |
| Optimality         | Sometimes (e.g., UCS) | Often (e.g., A\*)          |
| Applicability      | General problems      | Specific, complex problems |
| Examples           | BFS, DFS, UCS         | Greedy, A\*, Hill Climbing |

### Advanced Search Techniques <a href="#advanced-search-techniques" id="advanced-search-techniques"></a>

While uninformed and informed searches form the foundation of search algorithms, advanced techniques extend their capabilities:

1. **Metaheuristic Algorithms**: Techniques like Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, and Particle Swarm Optimization optimize complex problems by combining heuristic principles with stochastic methods.
2. **Adversarial Search**: Applied in competitive environments, such as games, where multiple agents with conflicting goals interact (e.g., the Minimax algorithm).
3. **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)**: Focused on finding solutions that meet specific constraints, often using methods like backtracking and local search.
