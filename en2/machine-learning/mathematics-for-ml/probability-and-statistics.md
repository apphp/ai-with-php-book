Basic Probability Concepts

* Probability spaces, events, and outcomes
* Conditional probability and independence
* Random Variables and Distributions
* Discrete and continuous random variables
* Common probability distributions: Normal, Binomial, Poisson, etc.
* Expectation and Variance
* **Mathematical Expectation and Algorithm Evaluation**
* Mean, variance, and standard deviation
* Covariance and correlation
* Statistical Inference
* Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals
* Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)\

* Descriptive and inferential statistics applied to AI
  * Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion
  * Data Visualization in AI
  * Statistical Inference for Supervised Learning
  * Hypothesis Testing in Validation of AI Models:
* Bayes' theorem and its application in machine learning
  * Application in Bayesian Classification
  * Probabilistic Graphic Models
  * Bayesian Learning Algorithms
  * Bayes Theorem in Parameter Estimation
