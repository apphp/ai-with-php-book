4\. Mechanical Language Devices

• George Boole’s Algebra of Logic (1847): Boole’s work introduced a mathematical approach to reasoning, which underpins modern computational methods in NLP.

3\. Formal Logic and Symbolic Language

• Gottlob Frege’s Symbolic Logic (1879): Frege developed a formal system for logic that laid the foundation for computational reasoning and formal semantics in NLP.
