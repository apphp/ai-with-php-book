### 1. OpenAI Integrations for PHP

#### OpenAI PHP Client

Official website: [https://github.com/openai-php](https://github.com/openai-php)

One of the most powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries available for PHP developers is the **OpenAI PHP Client**. This library provides an easy-to-use interface for integrating OpenAI’s language models, including GPT-based models, into PHP applications. The OpenAI PHP Client is designed to simplify communication with OpenAI’s API.

#### OpenAI PHP Extension

Official website: [https://openai-php.com](https://openai-php.com/)

The OpenAI PHP is an extension that allows PHP developers to integrate the powerful capabilities of OpenAI into their applications. Activating the extension on the web server will allow users to quickly access the services offered by OpenAI without additional libraries in PHP.

### 2. General NLP/AI Frameworks for PHP

#### EasyAI-PHP

Official website: [https://github.com/HosonoDE/EasyAI-PHP](https://github.com/HosonoDE/EasyAI-PHP)

EasyAI-PHP is an open-source initiative designed to significantly simplify the entry into artificial intelligence for PHP-developers (so basically Lang-Chain for PHP). This project integrates advanced AI models and utilities, allowing developers to incorporate complex AI functionalities with minimal coding.

#### LLPhant

Official website: [https://github.com/theodo-group/LLPhant](https://github.com/theodo-group/LLPhant)

LLPhant - A comprehensive PHP Generative AI Framework

#### TransformersPHP

State-of-the-art Machine Learning for PHP. Run Transformers natively in your PHP projects

Official website: [https://codewithkyrian.github.io/transformers-php/](https://codewithkyrian.github.io/transformers-php/)

#### MITIE PHP

Official website: [https://github.com/ankane/mitie-php](https://github.com/ankane/mitie-php)

MITIE for PHP is a wrapper for using MITIE's NLP capabilities in PHP, including named-entity recognition, relation detection, and text categorization. It can identify entities such as people, organizations, and locations in text. It also detects relationships, like identifying that a person was born in a specific location.

### **3. NLP Agent & Workflow Frameworks**

#### LLM Agents PHP SDK **(PHP LLM-based AI Agents Library)**

Official website: [https://github.com/llm-agents-php/agents](https://github.com/llm-agents-php/agents)

The **LLM Agents PHP SDK** is a robust PHP library designed to facilitate the creation and management of Language Model (LLM)-based agents. It offers a comprehensive framework that enables developers to build autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks, making informed decisions, and interacting seamlessly with various tools and APIs.

* **Agent Creation:** Define and configure LLM-based agents with customizable behaviors.
* **Tool Integration:** Connect agents with various tools and APIs for extended functionality.
* **Memory Management:** Enable agents to retain and recall information for better context.
* **Prompt Handling:** Manage prompts efficiently to guide agent responses.
* **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add new agent types, tools, and capabilities.
* **Multi-Agent Support:** Allow multiple agents to collaborate on complex tasks.

### **4. NLP Utility Libraries**

#### DeepL-php (PHP client library for the DeepL API)

Official website: [https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-php](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-php)

The DeepL API is a language translation API that allows other computer programs to send texts and documents to DeepL's servers and receive high-quality translations. This opens a whole universe of opportunities for developers: any translation product you can imagine can now be built on top of DeepL's best-in-class translation technology.

#### PHP NlpTools

Official website: [https://github.com/angeloskath/php-nlp-tools](https://github.com/angeloskath/php-nlp-tools)

PHP library for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It includes tools for tokenization, classification (Naive Bayes, MaxEnt), clustering, and text similarity. Designed for PHP developers, it enables NLP without relying on external services. The library is open source and well-documented.

#### PHP Text Analysis

Official website: [https://github.com/yooper/php-text-analysis](https://github.com/yooper/php-text-analysis)

PHP Text Analysis is a PHP library for Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It offers tools for document classification, sentiment analysis, tokenization, stemming, and frequency analysis. Additional features include text comparison, lexical diversity, corpus analysis, collocations, and summarization.

#### PHP Language Detection

Official website: [https://github.com/patrickschur/language-detection](https://github.com/patrickschur/language-detection)

This library can detect the language of a given text string. It can parse given training text in many different idioms into a sequence of N-grams and builds a database file in PHP to be used in the detection phase. Then it can take a given text and detect its language using the database previously generated in the training phase. The library comes with text samples used for training and detecting text in 110 languages.\
