# NLP Processing Methods

Natural Language Processing involves a structured pipeline of techniques that transform raw text into meaningful data a machine can understand and act upon. These methods are essential for a wide range of AI applications, from virtual assistants and search engines to automated translation and sentiment analysis. In this section, we walk through the foundational components of NLP systems, offering practical insights into each stage of the process.

We begin with the **NLP workflow**, which outlines the typical steps taken to process language data â€”from data collection and cleaning, through tokenization and normalization, to model building and evaluation. Then, we delve into **text preprocessing**, a critical stage that includes removing noise, standardizing content, and preparing text for downstream tasks. Next, we cover **feature extraction techniques**, which transform words and sentences into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.

A key concept in modern NLP is **distributional semantics**, which captures the meaning of words based on their context and usage patterns. This lays the foundation for more sophisticated models and embeddings. Finally, we explore the **categories of NLP models**, including **pure statistical models**, **neural network-based approaches**, and **notable models** like BERT or GPT that have significantly advanced the field. This comprehensive overview equips readers with the understanding needed to implement effective NLP solutions and appreciate the inner workings of language-aware AI systems.
