# Basic NLP Tasks

Basic NLP tasks are the foundational problems in Natural Language Processing — the “building blocks” that most language AI systems solve in some way.



***

#### 1. Tokenization

* What: Splitting text into smaller units like words or subwords.
*   Example:

    Input: _“I love NLP.”_

    Output: \["I", "love", "NLP", "."]
* Why: Every NLP model needs text in tokenized form.

***

#### 2. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging

* What: Label each word with its grammatical role (noun, verb, adjective…).
*   Example:

    _“Dogs run fast.”_ → \[(Dogs, Noun), (run, Verb), (fast, Adverb)]
* Why: Useful for syntax-aware systems like grammar checkers.

***

#### 3. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

* What: Find and classify “real-world” entities in text (people, places, organizations).
*   Example:

    _“Apple released the iPhone in California.”_ →

    \[(Apple, Organization), (iPhone, Product), (California, Location)]
* Why: Critical for search engines, chatbots, info extraction.

***

#### 4. Sentiment Analysis

* What: Determine the emotional tone of a text (positive, negative, neutral).
*   Example:

    _“This movie was fantastic!”_ → Positive
* Why: Used in social media monitoring, reviews, etc.

***

#### 5. Machine Translation

* What: Automatically translate text between languages.
*   Example:

    _“Bonjour tout le monde”_ → _“Hello everyone”_
* Why: Core for global communication tools.

***

#### 6. Question Answering (QA)

* What: Find answers to questions from text.
*   Example:

    Text: _“Paris is the capital of France.”_

    Q: _“What is the capital of France?”_ → _“Paris”_
* Why: Foundation for search and assistants.

***

#### 7. Text Summarization

* What: Generate a concise version of a longer text.
*   Example:

    Input: A 5-page news article

    Output: _“Key events summarized in 3 sentences”_
* Why: Used in news, legal, and research tools.

***



#### 8. Text Generation

* What: Generate new text based on a prompt.
*   Example:

    Prompt: _“Write a poem about the sea”_ →

    _“The waves crash softly on the shore…”_
* Why: Core for chatbots, code assistants, content creation.

***

#### 9. Text Classification

* What: Assign predefined labels to text.
*   Example:

    _“This email is spam.”_ → Spam
* Why: Email filtering, topic detection.

***

#### 10. Dependency Parsing

* What: Analyze grammatical structure by showing how words relate.
*   Example:

    _“She eats an apple.”_ → _“eats”_ is the root, _“She”_ is subject, _“apple”_ is object.
