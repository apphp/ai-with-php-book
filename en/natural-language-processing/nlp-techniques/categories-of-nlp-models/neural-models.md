# Neural Models

* Connolutional Neural Networks (CNN) -&#x20;
* **RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs**
* Pooling
* Attention Mechanism, self-attention and BERT
* **Transformer-based Models**
  * Self-attention, positional encoding, encoder-decoder
  * Examples: BERT, GPT-3, T5
* **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
  * Trained on massive corpora with billions of parameter

Exotic

* memory neural networks (neural turing machine)
* tree-recursove NN
* graph Connolutional Neural Networks (GCN) -&#x20;
