# Introduction

In the realm of artificial intelligence, few fields are as dynamic and impactful as Natural Language Processing (NLP). At its core, NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a way that feels natural and intuitive. From chatbots that provide real-time support to systems that translate languages or summarize complex documents, NLP bridges the gap between human communication and computational power.

In this part of the book we'll introduce the fundamental concepts of NLP and demonstrate how PHP, a popular server-side scripting language, can be leveraged to create NLP-powered applications. Weâ€™ll explore the intersection of linguistics, machine learning, and PHP tools that make language processing both accessible and practical for developers.
