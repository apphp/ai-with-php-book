# Frame Representation

### 3. Frame Representation

A frame is a structured data entity that groups related attributes and values to describe an object or situation. Frames are organized into collections, where each frame consists of **slots** (attributes) and **facets** (constraints or additional details).

**Schema:**

```
Frame: Book
  - Title: Artificial Intelligence
  - Genre: Computer Science
  - Author: Peter Norvig
  - Edition: Third
  - Year: 1996
  - Pages: 1152
```

**Advantages:**

* Simplifies programming by structuring related data.
* Highly flexible and adaptable.
* Supports default values and missing data handling.

**Disadvantages:**

* Does not inherently support advanced inference mechanisms.
* Can be overly generalized, limiting complex reasoning.
