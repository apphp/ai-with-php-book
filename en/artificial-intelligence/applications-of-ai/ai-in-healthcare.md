### AI in Cancer Diagnosis

One of the most promising applications of AI in healthcare is in medical imaging. IBM’s Watson Health, along with other AI-driven diagnostic tools, is used to analyze radiology images to detect early signs of cancer, such as breast cancer, with greater accuracy. In 2020, Google Health developed an AI system capable of identifying breast cancer in mammograms more effectively than human radiologists. By applying deep learning models, AI systems can analyze thousands of medical images, reducing human error and improving early detection rates.

### Predicting Disease Progression

AI is also being used to predict the progression of diseases. For instance, Google’s DeepMind developed an AI model called AlphaFold, which predicts the 3D structure of proteins. Understanding protein folding is key to many diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. By accurately predicting how proteins fold, AlphaFold provides crucial insights into disease mechanisms, opening the door to new drug discoveries.

### Virtual Health Assistants

AI-powered virtual assistants are increasingly used in healthcare to provide patients with personalized advice and reminders. Babylon Health, for example, offers an AI-driven platform where users can chat with a virtual doctor to assess symptoms and receive recommendations for treatment. This reduces the burden on healthcare providers and improves access to care, particularly in underserved areas.
