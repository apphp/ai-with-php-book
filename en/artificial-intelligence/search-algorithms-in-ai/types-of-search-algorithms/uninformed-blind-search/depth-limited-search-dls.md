# Depth-limited Search (DLS)

#### Depth-Limited Search

DFS with a depth limit to prevent infinite exploration. It is incomplete if the goal lies beyond the depth limit.

* **Time Complexity**: Same as DFS.
* **Space Complexity**: Same as DFS.
* **Use Case**: Solving problems with known depth constraints.
