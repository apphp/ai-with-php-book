# Uniform Cost Search (UCS)



UCS expands the node with the lowest path cost, ensuring an optimal solution if all costs are non-negative.

* **Time Complexity:** $$O(b^{1+\lfloor C^/\epsilon\rfloor})$$_, where_ is the cost of the optimal solution and  is the minimum cost of any action.
* **Space Complexity**: $$O(b^{1+\lfloor C^*/\epsilon\rfloor})$$.
* **Use Case**: Finding the cheapest path in a weighted graph.
