| Feature            | Uninformed Search     | Informed Search            |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Knowledge Required | None                  | Domain-specific heuristics |
| Efficiency         | Lower                 | Higher                     |
| Optimality         | Sometimes (e.g., UCS) | Often (e.g., A\*)          |
| Applicability      | General problems      | Specific, complex problems |
| Examples           | BFS, DFS, UCS         | Greedy, A\*, Hill Climbing |

CommentWhile uninformed and informed searches form the foundation of search algorithms, there are advanced techniques that extend their capabilities:Comment1. Metaheuristic Algorithms: Algorithms like Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, and Particle Swarm Optimization optimize complex problems by combining heuristic principles with stochastic methods.Comment2. Adversarial Search: Used in competitive environments, such as games, where multiple agents with conflicting goals interact (e.g., Minimax algorithm).Comment3. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs): Focus on finding solutions that satisfy specific constraints, often using techniques like backtracking and local search.
