# Iterative Deepening A\*

Combines the memory efficiency of IDDFS with the optimality of A\*. It performs a series of depth-limited A\* searches.

• Time Complexity: Similar to A\*.

• Space Complexity: Reduced compared to standard A\*.

• Advantages: Balances memory use and optimality.

• Disadvantages: May involve redundant calculations.

• Use Case: Problems requiring optimal solutions in constrained memory environments.
