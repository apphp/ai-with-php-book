# A\* Graph vs A\* Tree Search

A\* Tree Search is effective but can be inefficient because it may re-explore branches it has already traversed. In simpler terms, if the same node is expanded through multiple branches of the search tree, A\* Tree Search might redundantly explore both, leading to wasted time.

A\* Graph Search, also known as simply Graph Search, addresses this issue by introducing a key rule: each node is expanded only once.

A\* Graph Search improves on A\* Tree Search by eliminating redundancy in node expansion through the use of a closed list. While it may require more memory, it significantly enhances efficiency and guarantees optimality with a consistent heuristic, making it more suitable for solving complex problems involving large graphs.
