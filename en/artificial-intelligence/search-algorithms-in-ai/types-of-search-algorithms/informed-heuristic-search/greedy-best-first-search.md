# Greedy Best-First Search

• Time Complexity: Dependent on the heuristic quality, typically O(b^m), where m is the maximum depth.

• Space Complexity: O(b^m).

• Advantages: Fast and often effective for certain problems.

• Disadvantages: Does not guarantee an optimal solution; prone to suboptimal paths.

• Use Case: Navigational problems where a rough estimate of distance suffices (e.g., GPS systems).
