# Informed (Heuristic) Search

Informed search algorithms utilize problem-specific knowledge to guide the search, making them more efficient than uninformed methods. This knowledge, known as a heuristic, estimates the cost to reach the goal from a given state. While heuristics do not guarantee the best solution, they often provide good solutions within a reasonable timeframe.

### Key Characteristics of Informed Search

1\. Uses Heuristics: Guides the search process based on domain knowledge.

2\. More Efficient: Requires fewer node expansions compared to uninformed methods.

3\. Handles Complex Problems: Solves problems that are computationally infeasible for uninformed search.
