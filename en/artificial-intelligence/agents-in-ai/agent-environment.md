# Agent Environment

### Features of Environment

As per Russell and Norvig, an environment can have various features from the point of view of an agent:

1. Fully observable vs Partially Observable
2. Static vs Dynamic
3. Discrete vs Continuous
4. Deterministic vs Stochastic
5. Single-agent vs Multi-agent
6. Episodic vs sequential
7. Known vs Unknown
8. Accessible vs Inaccessible

• Types of environments: Fully observable vs. partially observable, deterministic vs. stochastic, episodic vs. sequential, static vs. dynamic, discrete vs. continuous.

• How agents perceive and act within different environments.
