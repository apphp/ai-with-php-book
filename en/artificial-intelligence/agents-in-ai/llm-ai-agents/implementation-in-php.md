# Implementation in PHP

In this chapter, we dive into implementing Large Language Model (LLM) AI Agents with PHP. Implementing LLM AI agents in PHP has become more accessible with the development of the LLM Agents PHP SDK. This SDK offers a structured framework for integrating LLM-based agents into PHP applications, enabling developers to create intelligent systems capable of understanding and responding to user inputs, processing information, and interacting with various tools and APIs.​&#x20;

**Key Features of LLM Agents PHP SDK:**

* **Agent Creation:** Developers can create and configure LLM-based agents with customizable behaviors, tailoring them to specific application needs.​
* **Tool Integration:** The SDK allows seamless integration of various tools and APIs, enhancing the agent's capabilities within PHP applications.​
* **Memory Management:** Agents can retain and recall information across interactions, facilitating more coherent and contextually relevant responses.
* **Prompt Management:** Efficient handling of prompts and instructions guides agent behavior, ensuring responses align with user expectations.​
* **Extensible Architecture:** The framework supports the addition of new agent types, tools, and capabilities, promoting scalability and adaptability.​
* **Multi-Agent Support:** Developers can build systems with multiple interacting agents, enabling complex problem-solving scenarios.​
