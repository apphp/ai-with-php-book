The term AI is composed of two words: "artificial," meaning man-made, and "intelligence," referring to thinking power. Therefore, AI can be understood as "man-made thinking power."

AI is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of behaving like humans, thinking like humans, and making decisions autonomously. Unlike traditional programming, where every action is predefined, AI-powered systems use algorithms that enable them to learn, reason, and solve problems on their own. This ability to act without pre-programming makes AI a revolutionary tool for various industries, from healthcare to robotics.

By understanding the foundational concepts of AI, we can grasp how machines are evolving to mirror human skills, providing innovative solutions to complex challenges and driving technological advancements across the globe.

### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

There’s a lot of confusion today surrounding the terms artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. In fact, these terms are interconnected, with machine learning and deep learning being specific parts (or rather subsets) of artificial intelligence.

### What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence is the field of study that focuses on creating systems capable of intelligent behavior. Some definitions describe it as the study or design of _**intelligent agents**_. An agent in this context can be either software or hardware that interacts with its environment and takes actions to maximize its chances of success.

### Intelligence Definition

For the purposes of this book, an intelligent agent is one that solves a problem optimally. This means that the system determines the best course of action independently, figuring out what will lead to the most successful outcome.

### How Intelligent Decisions Are Made

1. **Learning from experience**: The agent keeps track of its actions and evaluates whether they lead to positive or negative outcomes. It then uses this knowledge to compare new actions with past experiences.
2. **Simulating outcomes**: Before taking action, the agent can simulate possible outcomes (whether the action is good or bad) and choose the least harmful or most beneficial one. This requires an abstraction, or model, of the world. It’s important to note that a model of the world is just a representation, not the world itself.

### A Fun Fact about AI

Interestingly, once a problem is fully solved by AI, it's often no longer considered "intelligent." For example, teaching a computer to play chess was once seen as the pinnacle of intelligence. Today, however, it's a routine task, and no longer regarded as a particularly advanced demonstration of AI.
