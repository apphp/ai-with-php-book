# Semi-Formal Logic

**Semi-formal logic** combines elements of both formal and informal logic. It uses structured rules but allows for uncertainty and natural language interpretation.

**Key Features:**

* Combines rules (formal) with context (informal)
* Can include degrees of belief or probability
* Suitable for systems needing both structure and flexibility

**Example:**

> "If the temperature is below 0°C, and the road is wet, there’s a high chance of ice."

This sentence has structure, but includes uncertainty (“high chance”).

**Used in:** Legal AI, expert systems, decision support tools, ethical AI

**Types of Semi-Formal Logic:**

* **Fuzzy logic**
* **Probabilistic logic**
* **Rule-based systems with exceptions**
