# Informal Logic

**Informal logic** is how people reason in everyday life. It’s based on language, experience, and common sense rather than symbols or strict steps.

**Key Features:**

* Uses natural language (like English)
* Often relies on assumptions, context, or general knowledge
* Not always strictly valid, but practical and persuasive

**Example:**

> "The sky is very cloudy, so it might rain soon."

This isn’t a rule with a guaranteed outcome, but it’s a reasonable guess based on past experience.

**Used in:** Chatbots, argument mining, fake news detection, and conversational AI

**Informal Logic Tools:**

* **Argument maps**
* **Fallacy detection** (e.g., straw man, slippery slope)
* **Rhetorical analysis**
