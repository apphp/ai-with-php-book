# Logic and Reasoning

Logic and reasoning form the foundation of both classical and modern AI. They give machines the ability to make decisions, solve problems, and understand rules in a structured way. Whether it's answering a question, planning a move, or detecting patterns, logic helps computers act intelligently.

This section of book introduces the core ideas of logic and reasoning. You will learn what logic is, how reasoning works, and why both are important in building intelligent systems. We will focus on few types of logic used in AI: **propositional logic**, which works with simple true/false statements, **first-order logic**, which can describe more complex facts about objects and their relationships and some other.

We will also explore **reasoning**, which is the process of using logic to reach conclusions. AI systems use **deductive reasoning** to apply general rules to specific cases, and **inductive reasoning** to discover rules from repeated observations â€” an approach commonly used in machine learning.

In mathematics - reasoning is the process of thinking logically about mathematics. It involves analyzing mathematical concepts, making connections between them, and applying logical principles to solve problems and draw conclusions.

By the end of this section, you will understand how logic helps AI systems:

* Represent knowledge clearly
* Follow logical rules
* Solve problems step-by-step
* Make explainable decisions

These skills are essential for many AI applications, such as expert systems, chatbots, and automated planning tools. Understanding logic and reasoning is the first step toward teaching machines how to think.
