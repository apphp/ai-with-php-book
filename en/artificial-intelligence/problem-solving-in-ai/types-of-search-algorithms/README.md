# Types of Search Algorithms

Search algorithms are essential tools in artificial intelligence, enabling agents to systematically explore a problem space to find solutions.&#x20;

Based on the nature of the problem and the availability of information, search algorithms can be broadly classified into two categories: **Uninformed (Blind) Search** and **Informed (Heuristic) Search**. This chapter delves into these categories, exploring their characteristics, applications, and examples.

Understanding the types of search algorithms in AI is crucial for selecting the right approach for a given problem. Uninformed search offers a straightforward, brute-force methodology suitable for simpler tasks, while informed search leverages domain knowledge to efficiently tackle complex challenges. Beyond these, advanced techniques open doors to solving real-world problems in diverse domains, from robotics to optimization and decision-making systems.&#x20;
