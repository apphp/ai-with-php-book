# Hill Climbing Algorithm

A local search algorithm that iteratively moves to a neighboring node with a better heuristic value.

• Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the search space.

• Space Complexity: O(1).

• Advantages: Simple and uses minimal memory.

• Disadvantages: Prone to getting stuck in local optima.

• Use Case: Optimization tasks, such as tuning parameters in machine learning models.
