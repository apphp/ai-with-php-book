Here are the **Core Principles of AI Ethics**:

1. **Transparency**\
   AI systems should be clear about how they work and make decisions. People should know when they’re interacting with AI and have access to understandable explanations.
2. **Fairness**\
   AI should treat everyone equally. It should not discriminate against people based on race, gender, background, or any other unfair reason.
3. **Accountability**\
   Humans should take responsibility for the actions and impacts of AI systems. If something goes wrong, there should be a clear person or group who is responsible.
4. **Privacy**\
   AI must respect people’s personal data. Information should be protected, and people should have control over how their data is used.
5. **Safety and Security**\
   AI systems should be built to avoid harm. They need to be secure from attacks and tested to make sure they work safely.
6. **Beneficence (Doing Good)**\
   AI should help people and improve lives. It should be designed to support human well-being and not cause harm.
7. **Autonomy**\
   AI should support human freedom and decision-making. It shouldn't manipulate people or take away their ability to choose.
