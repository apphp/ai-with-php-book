# Key Applications of AI Ethics

1. **Hiring and Recruitment**\
   AI is often used to screen job applications, but it must be fair and unbiased. Ethical AI ensures candidates are judged equally, regardless of gender, race, or background.
2. **Healthcare**\
   AI can help diagnose diseases and suggest treatments. It’s important that these systems are accurate, explainable, and respect patient privacy.
3. **Finance**\
   Banks and lenders use AI to make decisions about loans or detect fraud. Ethical AI makes sure these decisions are fair, secure, and don’t discriminate.
4. **Education**\
   AI tools in schools or online learning platforms must protect student data, provide equal opportunities, and avoid reinforcing stereotypes.
5. **Law Enforcement and Surveillance**\
   AI is used in facial recognition and predictive policing. To prevent misuse, there must be strong rules around privacy, accuracy, and accountability.
6. **Social Media and Content Moderation**\
   AI helps recommend content and block harmful posts. Ethical use requires transparency and efforts to avoid bias or manipulation.
7. **Autonomous Vehicles and Robotics**\
   Self-driving cars and robots must be built with safety and decision-making ethics in mind, especially in life-or-death situations.
