# Basic NN

A basic neural network that uses a Simple Perceptron. The Simple Perceptron is a fundamental building block in machine learning and neural networks, inspired by the functioning of biological neurons.

Developed by **Frank Rosenblatt** in 1958, it offers a straightforward approach to binary classification tasks. Despite its simplicity, the perceptron laid the groundwork for the development of modern neural networks. This chapter explores the structure, working mechanism, strengths, and limitations of the Simple Perceptron, along with a practical implementation using PHP.
