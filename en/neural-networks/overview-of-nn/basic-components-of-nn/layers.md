# Layers

### Organizing the Network

Neural networks are structured in layers, each serving a unique purpose. These layers work together to transform the input data into meaningful outputs.

### Types of Layers

#### **1. Input Layer:**

* The entry point of the network.
* Each neuron in this layer corresponds to a feature of the input data. For example, in image processing, each pixel value might represent a neuron.
* No computation occurs here; it simply forwards the input data to the next layer.

#### **2. Hidden Layers:**

* These are the intermediate layers where the actual computations take place.
* The number of hidden layers and neurons per layer determines the networkâ€™s complexity and capacity to model intricate patterns.
* Hidden layers use activation functions to learn non-linear transformations.

#### **3. Output Layer:**

* Produces the final output of the network.
* The number of neurons here corresponds to the number of output classes or the dimension of the predicted value.
* For example:
  * In binary classification, the output layer has one neuron with a sigmoid activation function.
  * In multi-class classification, the output layer uses softmax activation to produce probabilities for each class.
