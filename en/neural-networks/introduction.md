  Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain that
  process data, recognize patterns, and enable tasks like image recognition and
  decision-making.

Neural networks are a big part of modern machine learning. They work like a simplified version of the human brain, using connected points, called neurons, to process and learn from data. By finding patterns and links in the data, neural networks help machines do things like recognize images, understand language, and make decisions with amazing accuracy.

In this part of the book, we’ll explain the basics of neural networks: how they work, their structure, and how they’re used in artificial intelligence. From simple neurons to complex systems, you’ll learn how neural networks are changing technology and industries around the world.
