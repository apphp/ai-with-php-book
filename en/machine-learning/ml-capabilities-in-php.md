While PHP is not traditionally associated with machine learning, it has several libraries and frameworks that enable developers to implement basic machine learning algorithms and integrate machine learning functionalities into web applications.

We'll explore key PHP libraries, such as Rubix ML and PHP-ML, which offer tools for tasks like classification, regression, and clustering. The chapter will also highlight practical applications of machine learning in PHP, such as recommendation systems, data analysis, and predictive modeling. By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear understanding of how to leverage PHP for machine learning projects and the advantages it brings to web development.
