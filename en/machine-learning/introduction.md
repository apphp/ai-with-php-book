Instead of relying on fixed rules, machine learning algorithms identify patterns and make decisions based on the data they receive. This ability to learn from experience makes machine learning particularly useful in various applications.

In traditional programming, developers write specific instructions to solve problems. In contrast, machine learning allows systems to automatically learn from examples and adapt to new information. This difference opens up exciting possibilities for developing intelligent systems capable of performing incredibly complex tasks.
