# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) involves an agent that interacts with an environment and learns to make decisions by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The agentâ€™s objective is to maximize cumulative rewards over time. This technique is widely used in game AI, robotics, and autonomous systems.

### Reinforcement Learning

Algorithms that learn through interactions with an environment, using rewards or penalties to improve behavior.

* Q-Learning
* SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
* Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
* Policy Gradients
* Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
* Bayesian Q-Learning. (tasks: Optimal Decision-Making, Handling Uncertainty, Exploration vs. Exploitation, Adaptation to Changes )
* (In-context Reinforcement Learning
