# Classification of ML Algorithms



### Each Algoritm:

* Type: (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, etc.)
* Task resolves: (regression, classification, clusterisation, dimension reduction)
* Methods used: (mathematics, statistical, Heuristic, Ensemble,  Bayesian etc)

### Supervised Learning

Algorithms that learn from labeled data, where each example has input data and a corresponding label.

*   TASK (Regression):

    * Linear Regression
    * Polynomial Regression
    * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    * Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    * Lasso Regression
    * Ridge Regression
    * Bayesian Linear Regression:


*   TASK (Classification):

    * Logistic Regression (combines statistical principles with machine learning techniques !!!!)
    * Decision Trees
    * Random Forests
    * k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    * Naive Bayes Classifier
    * Neural Networks


*   TASK ( (both Regression & Classification))

    * Boosting - (both Regression & Classification)
    * Gradient Boosting - (both Regression & Classification)
    * Bagging - (Bootstrap Aggregation)(both Regression & Classification)
    * Stacking


* TAKS (Optimization, hyperparameter tuning)
  * Bayesian Optimization&#x20;



### Unsupervised Learning

Algorithms that work with unlabeled data to identify structures and hidden patterns.

* TASK (Clustering):
  * k-Means
  * Hierarchical Clustering
  * DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
  * Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
* TASK (Dimensionality Reduction):
  * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  * Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  * t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
  * Autoencoders
* TASK (Search and Optimization)
  *   ### Heuristic Methods

      Methods that use approximations to find solutions for complex problems.

      • Genetic Algorithms

      • Ant Colony Optimization

      • Particle Swarm Optimization



### Semi-Supervised Learning

Algorithms that use a small amount of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data.

• Self-training Algorithms

• Co-training

• Graph-based Methods



### Reinforcement Learning

Algorithms that learn through interactions with an environment, using rewards or penalties to improve behavior.

* Q-Learning
* SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
* Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
* Policy Gradients
* Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
* Bayesian Q-Learning. (tasks: Optimal Decision-Making, Handling Uncertainty, Exploration vs. Exploitation, Adaptation to Changes )

### Distributed Learning

Algorithms that split the training process across multiple machines or devices to handle large datasets and speed up computations.

• Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (Distributed SGD)

• Federated Learning

• MapReduce for ML

• Horovod (for deep learning models)

• Apache Spark MLlib









### Bayesian Methods (New Subcategory)

• Bayesian Networks
