### Example 1

Imagine you’re a data scientist working for a real estate company, and you need to predict housing prices based on features like **square footage**. Given a dataset of past housing sales, you can use Linear Regression to create a model that predicts the price of a house based on these attributes.

For instance:

* **Input**: Square footage
* **Output**: Estimated house price.

With this model, you can input new values (square footage and bedroom count of a new property) to predict the selling price.\
\
Square Footage (sq ft) Price ($)

| Square Footage (sq ft) | Price ($) |
| ---------------------- | --------- |
| 1000                   | 150,000   |
| 1500                   | 200,000   |
| 2000                   | 250,000   |
| 2500                   | 300,000   |
| 3000                   | 350,000   |



With linear regression, we can feed in the square footage and let the algorithm find the best-fitting line. Then, if someone asks, “How much would a 2200 sq ft house cost?” our model can give a pretty accurate answer.
