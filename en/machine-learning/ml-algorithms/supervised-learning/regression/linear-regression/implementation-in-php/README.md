# Implementation in PHP

In this chapter, we dive into implementing linear regression models in PHP, leveraging the power of machine learning libraries like **RubixML** and **PHP-ML**. Linear regression, one of the most fundamental techniques in machine learning, helps us uncover relationships between variables and make predictions based on historical data. By using PHP, a versatile and widely adopted language, we’ll explore how to build, train, and evaluate regression models that predict outcomes based on input features.

We'll start by understanding the core concepts behind linear regression, including how models learn from data through optimization techniques like gradient descent. Then, we’ll implement these concepts practically with the RubixML and PHP-ML libraries, which simplify complex mathematical operations and provide robust tools for training and evaluating machine learning models in PHP.
