Square Footage (sq ft) Price ($)

|      |         |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1000 | 150,000 |
| 1500 | 200,000 |
| 2000 | 250,000 |
| 2500 | 300,000 |
| 3000 | 350,000 |



With linear regression, we can feed in the square footage and let the algorithm find the best-fitting line. Then, if someone asks, “How much would a 2200 sq ft house cost?” our model can give a pretty accurate answer.
