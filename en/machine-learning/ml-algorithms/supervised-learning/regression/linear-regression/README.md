# Linear Regression ?..

Linear Regression is one of the simplest yet most powerful techniques in machine learning for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (output) and one or more independent variables (inputs). The fundamental principle behind linear regression is to fit a linear equation to observed data, allowing predictions of continuous outcomes based on input features.

Linear regression is widely used across various domains, including economics, social sciences, and engineering, because it provides both predictive power and interpretability. Applications range from predicting house prices based on size and location to forecasting sales volumes from historical trends.
