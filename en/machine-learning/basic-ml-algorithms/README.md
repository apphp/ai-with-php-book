Each category is defined by its approach to learning from data and the types of problems it addresses.

* Supervised Learning focuses on training models using labeled data, allowing them to make predictions based on known outcomes. This approach is commonly used in tasks like classification and regression.
* Unsupervised Learning deals with unlabeled data, where the model identifies patterns and structures without specific guidance. This category is often applied in clustering and anomaly detection.
* Reinforcement Learning involves training an agent to make decisions in an environment by learning from the consequences of its actions, seeking to maximize rewards over time.

By understanding these categories, you will gain insight into the various methodologies used in machine learning and their real-world applications.
