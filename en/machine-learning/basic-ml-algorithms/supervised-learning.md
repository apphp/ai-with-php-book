# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the most common type of machine learning. In this approach, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning the data contains both the inputs and the correct outputs. The goal is for the algorithm to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, so it can predict the output for unseen data. Common use cases include **classification** and **regression** tasks.
