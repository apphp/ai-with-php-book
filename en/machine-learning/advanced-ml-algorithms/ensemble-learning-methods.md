# Ensemble Learning Methods

• Random Forests: An ensemble of decision trees that combine their predictions for better accuracy and robustness.

• Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Build models sequentially, where each model corrects errors made by the previous one. Variants include XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
