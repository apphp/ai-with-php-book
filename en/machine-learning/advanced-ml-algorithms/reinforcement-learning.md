# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) involves an agent that interacts with an environment and learns to make decisions by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The agentâ€™s objective is to maximize cumulative rewards over time. This technique is widely used in game AI, robotics, and autonomous systems.
