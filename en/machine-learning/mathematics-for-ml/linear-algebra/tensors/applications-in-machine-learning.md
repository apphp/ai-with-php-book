# Applications in Machine Learning

### Common Applications in Machine Learning

#### 1. Neural Networks

* Input tensors: Batches of data
* Weight tensors: Learnable parameters
* Activation tensors: Layer outputs

#### 2. Computer Vision

* Image tensors: (batch\_size, height, width, channels)
* Convolutional kernels: (kernel\_height, kernel\_width, in\_channels, out\_channels)
* Feature maps: Outputs of convolutional layers

#### 3. Natural Language Processing

* Word embeddings: (vocabulary\_size, embedding\_dim)
* Sequence data: (batch\_size, sequence\_length, feature\_dim)
* Attention matrices: (batch\_size, num\_heads, sequence\_length, sequence\_length)
