# Tensor Operations

### Tensor Operations Explained

Tensors, multi-dimensional arrays that generalize vectors and matrices, are fundamental to fields such as machine learning, physics, and computer graphics. Below, we explore essential tensor operations and their applications, building a foundation for effective tensor manipulation and computation.

#### **Tensor Product (⊗)**

The **tensor product** (or outer product) combines two tensors to create a higher-dimensional tensor, such as producing a matrix from two vectors.

**Example**:\
Given $$u = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$$ and $$v = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$$, &#x20;

the tensor product $$u \otimes v$$ results in:

$$u \otimes v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \times 3 & 1 \times 4 \\ 2 \times 3 & 2 \times 4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 4 \\ 6 & 8 \end{bmatrix}$$

#### **Contraction**

**Contraction** reduces a tensor’s rank by summing elements across specific dimensions. For instance, taking the trace of a matrix (summing diagonal elements) is a common contraction.

**Example**:\
For  $$T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$$, the trace is:&#x20;

$$\text{Trace} = T_{11} + T_{22} = 1 + 4 = 5$$

### Basic Tensor Operations

#### **Element-wise Operations**

These operations apply functions to each element independently in tensors of the same shape:

* **Addition**: $$C[i,j,k] = A[i,j,k] + B[i,j,k]$$
* **Multiplication**: $$C[i,j,k] = A[i,j,k] \times B[i,j,k]$$
* **Activation functions** (like `ReLU` and `sigmoid`) are applied element-wise in neural networks.
  * ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):
    * Function:  $$\text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)$$
    * Element-wise Application: For each element in the input tensor (whether it’s a vector, matrix, or higher-dimensional tensor), the function sets all negative values to zero while keeping positive values unchanged.
    *   Example:

        If the input $$A = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2 \\ -3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$$ , \
        applying ReLU gives: $$\text{ReLU}(A) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 \\ 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$$
  * Sigmoid:
    * Function:  $$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$
    * Element-wise Application: For each element in the input tensor, the sigmoid function maps the value to a range between 0 and 1. It is applied to each element of the tensor independently.
    *   Example:

        If the input  $$A = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2 \\ 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$$ , \
        applying the sigmoid gives: $$\sigma(A) = \begin{bmatrix} 0.2689 & 0.8808 \\ 0.5 & 0.9820 \end{bmatrix}$$

#### **Tensor Transposition**

Tensor transposition rearranges the dimensions of a tensor, enabling flexible reshaping and facilitating operations that require different axis orders. This is especially useful in multidimensional data manipulation, such as in machine learning and physics applications.

**Example**

Consider a 3-dimensional tensor AAA represented as:

$$A = \begin{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{bmatrix} \end{bmatrix}$$

In this notation:

* A has shape (2,2,2), where the first dimension has 2 blocks, each containing 2×2 matrix.

We want to **transpose** the tensor so that the last dimension becomes the first, effectively reshaping it from (2,2,2) to (2,2,2) but with a new order: $$A_{kij}$$ instead of $$A_{ijk}$$​.

#### **Broadcasting**

**Broadcasting** enables operations between tensors of different shapes by automatically expanding smaller dimensions to match larger ones.

**Example**:

* **Vector + Scalar**:\
  $$a = [1, 2, 3] \quad b = 2 \quad a + b = [3, 4, 5]$$\
  b is broadcast to \[2, 2, 2] for addition.
* **Matrix + Vector**:\
  $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}, \quad v = [1, 0, 1]$$\
  Result:\
  $$A + v = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 2 & 4 \\ 5 & 5 & 7 \end{bmatrix}$$

#### **Reshaping Operations**

**Reshaping** changes a tensor's layout without altering its data, often necessary for model compatibility.

**Example**:

To reshape a 2x3 matrix to 3x2:

$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}$$

### Advanced Tensor Operations

#### **Outer Product**

The **outer product** creates higher-dimensional tensors, useful in vector expansion for complex relationships.

**Example**:

Given $$u = [1, 2]$$ and $$v = [3, 4, 5]$$,  the outer product is: $$v = [3, 4, 5]$$

#### **Einstein Summation (einsum)**

**Einstein summation** provides a compact notation for complex tensor operations, like matrix multiplication, by aligning and summing indices.

**Example**:

To perform matrix multiplication:  $$C[i, k] = \sum_j A[i, j] \cdot B[j, k]$$

### Applications of Tensor Operations

  * For large, sparse tensors, consider sparse representations.
  * Optimize memory and leverage hardware acceleration.

These principles and techniques form the backbone of tensor operations, making them indispensable for efficient computation across various scientific and engineering disciplines.
