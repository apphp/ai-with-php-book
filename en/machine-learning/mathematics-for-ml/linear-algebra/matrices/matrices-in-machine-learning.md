# Matrices in Machine Learning

### Matrix Applications in AI and Machine Learning

Matrices can be used in various AI and machine learning algorithms, including:

1. **Linear Regression**: Matrix operations are fundamental in solving linear regression problems.
2. **Neural Networks**: Matrix multiplication is a core operation in neural network forward and backward propagation.
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Eigenvalue decomposition, which relies on matrix operations, is key to PCA.
4. **Support Vector Machines**: The kernel trick in SVMs often involves matrix operations.
5. **Collaborative Filtering**: Matrix factorization techniques are common in recommendation systems.
