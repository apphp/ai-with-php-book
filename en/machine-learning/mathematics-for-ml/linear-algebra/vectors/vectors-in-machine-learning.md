# Vectors in Machine Learning

### Vector Applications in Machine Learning

1. Data Representation: Each data point in a dataset can be represented as a vector.
2. Feature Vectors: In machine learning models, features of an instance are often represented as vectors.
3. Weight Vectors: Many ML algorithms use vectors to represent the weights of different features.
