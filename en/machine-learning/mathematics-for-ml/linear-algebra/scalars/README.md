# Scalars

### Scalars in Linear Algebra

Scalars are fundamental elements in linear algebra. They are single numerical values, typically real or complex numbers, that play a crucial role in vector and matrix operations. Unlike vectors or matrices, which represent multiple values or elements, scalars are single-valued quantities.

In linear algebra, scalars are used to scale vectors, multiply matrices, and perform various other operations that form the basis of many mathematical and practical applications.
