# Key Applications of ML

* Recommendation Systems: These algorithms suggest products, services, or content to users based on past behaviors, preferences, and interactions. For example, Netflix uses machine learning to recommend shows based on user history.\
  In PHP, recommendation systems are often built with collaborative filtering or content-based filtering techniques. Though PHP lacks extensive libraries for machine learning, you can connect it to Python-based machine learning models via APIs.
* Prediction: Predictive models use historical data to forecast future outcomes. A typical example would be predicting stock prices or demand forecasting in e-commerce.
* Classification: Classification tasks involve categorizing data into predefined groups. An example is spam detection in emails, where the algorithm classifies emails as either spam or not spam based on content and metadata.
