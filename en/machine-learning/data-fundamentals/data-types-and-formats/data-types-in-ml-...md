# Data Types in ML ?..

* **Types of Data in Machine Learning**
  * Numerical, categorical, text, image, time-series, and graph data.
  * How these data types are used and represented in ML.
* **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**
  * Handling missing values, normalization, standardization.
  * Basic transformations to prepare data for feature engineering.
* **Features in Machine Learning and Their Types** (proposed chapter)
  * **Chapter Content**: This chapter would discuss the role of features in ML, types of features (numerical, categorical, text, image-based, time-series, and graph-based), and feature engineering techniques for each type.
  * **Goal**: To introduce readers to feature types, why they matter, and how to use them effectively in various ML algorithms.
* **Feature Engineering and Selection**
  * Techniques for creating, selecting, and transforming features to improve model performance.
* **Data Splitting and Sampling Techniques**
  * Training, validation, and testing sets, along with cross-validation techniques.
