# Introduction

### Introduction to Data Processing in ML

Data processing is a foundational stage in any machine learning workflow. Transforming raw data into clean, structured, and relevant inputs enables models to extract insights and make accurate predictions. While it may seem like a preliminary step, data processing accounts for much of the work and contributes substantially to the quality and success of machine learning applications.

In this chapter, we’ll walk through the essential data processing techniques tailored for machine learning, covering the following core areas:

* **Data Cleaning:**\
  Eliminates noise, missing values, and inconsistencies to ensure a dependable dataset, establishing a trustworthy base for analysis and model training.
* **Normalization and Scaling:**\
  Ensures features are on comparable scales, which is critical for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes, helping prevent biases in model performance.
* **Feature Engineering:**\
  Focuses on extracting or creating new, meaningful features from raw data that can enhance predictive power, model interpretability, and overall effectiveness.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:**\
  Reduces the number of features strategically, simplifying models to improve efficiency while retaining essential information, which is particularly valuable for high-dimensional data.
* **Dataset Splitting:**\
  Involves dividing data into training, validation, and test sets to accurately evaluate model performance, helping avoid overfitting and ensuring generalizability.

These data processing techniques not only improve model accuracy and efficiency but also make machine learning projects more resilient to the challenges of real-world data, such as noise, imbalance, and high dimensionality. By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a robust understanding of how to prepare data for machine learning, setting a solid foundation for building effective and reliable models.
