# Local Search

Uninformed algorithms do not have any domain-specific knowledge; they rely only on the problem definition (e.g., the initial state, goal state, and available actions). Below the local uninformed algorithms **(focused the entire space):**

* **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)**: DFS with a limit on the depth of exploration, focusing on a local area of the search space.
* **Random Walk Search (RWS)**: Sometimes known as a drunkard's walk, is a stochastic process that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps.
