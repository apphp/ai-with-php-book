All the formulas, ideas, and code examples will be shown using PHP, so you can learn and apply the concepts step by step. PHP has been a leader in web development for decades, but its potential for artificial intelligence remains unexplored. We'll try to put PHP at the center of our learning, giving you the chance to explore how this powerful language can be used to build intelligent systems.
