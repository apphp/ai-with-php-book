# Introduction

Expert systems are one of the first and most important types of AI. They are designed to imitate how human experts make decisions in specific areas. Unlike regular computer programs that follow fixed instructions, expert systems use special knowledge bases and reasoning tools to solve complex problems, providing advice and solutions like a human expert.

The creation of expert systems was a major step forward for AI because it showed computers could mimic human thinking in specific fields. These systems started in the 1970s and became very popular in the 1980s. They helped solve problems where expert human knowledge was rare, costly, or took too long to obtain. Expert systems have been used widely in industries like medicine, finance, engineering, and manufacturing because they can store and apply expert knowledge efficiently.

Even as newer AI technologies like ML have appeared, expert systems remain very important. They now work alongside ML improving their reasoning skills and adaptability. While ML is good at finding patterns and making predictions from large amounts of data, expert systems help by providing clear explanations and specific reasoning. This makes expert systems especially valuable in areas where decisions must be clear and justified, such as healthcare and finance.

In this section, we will look more closely at expert systems, including their history, main parts, and how they are used today. Learning about expert systems helps us understand their role in the history of AI and highlights their continued importance in our increasingly advanced technological world.
