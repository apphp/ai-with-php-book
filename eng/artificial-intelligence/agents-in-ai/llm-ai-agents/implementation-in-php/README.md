# Implementation in PHP

In this chapter, we dive into implementing Large Language Model (LLM) AI Agents with PHP. Implementing LLM AI agents in PHP has become more accessible with the development of the LLM Agents PHP SDK. This SDK offers a structured framework for integrating LLM-based agents into PHP applications, enabling developers to create intelligent systems capable of understanding and responding to user inputs, processing information, and interacting with various tools and APIs.â€‹&#x20;
