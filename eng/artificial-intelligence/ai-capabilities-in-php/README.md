# AI Capabilities in PHP

PHP, traditionally known for web development, now offers powerful AI and machine learning capabilities. With libraries like **LLM Agents PHP SDK**, developers can build intelligent applications that process data, make predictions, and automate decision-making.

**LLM Agents PHP SDK** is a library designed for building and managing Language Model (LLM)-based agents. It provides a framework for creating autonomous agents that can understand user inputs, interact with APIs, and perform complex tasks efficiently. By integrating LLM capabilities into PHP applications, developers can create smart systems that analyze and respond to information dynamically.

While this section focuses on AI in PHP, machine learning libraries like [**PHP-ML**](../../en/machine-learning/ml-capabilities-in-php/introduction-to-php-ml.md)**,** [**Rubix ML**](../../en/machine-learning/ml-capabilities-in-php/introduction-to-rubix-ml.md) and others will be reviewed in the ML section, where weâ€™ll explore model training, data processing, and predictive analytics in greater detail. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, understanding AI in PHP opens exciting new possibilities for web and enterprise applications.
