# Logical Representation

Logical representation is a powerful technique in AI that uses formal logic to represent knowledge and reason about it systematically. By employing well-defined rules and symbols, logical representation enables machines to infer new information, verify facts, and solve complex problems. This section explores different forms of logic, such as propositional and first-order logic, highlighting their role in building intelligent systems capable of reasoning and decision-making.

Logical representation is categorized into two primary types:

* **Propositional Logic:** Uses simple declarative statements (true/false) for reasoning.
* **Predicate Logic:** Extends propositional logic by incorporating variables, predicates, and quantifiers.
