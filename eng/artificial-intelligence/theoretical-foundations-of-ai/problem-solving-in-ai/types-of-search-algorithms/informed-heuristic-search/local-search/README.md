# Local Search

Informed search algorithms use heuristics or domain-specific knowledge to guide the search, making them more efficient. Below the global informed algorithms **(optimized within a local neighborhood):**

* **Beam Search**: Heuristic search algorithm designed to balance memory consumption and search efficiency in graph-based problems.
* **Hill-Climbing Search**: A greedy algorithm that continuously moves in the direction of increasing value, aiming to reach a local maximum.
* **Simulated Annealing**: Inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, this algorithm allows for occasional moves to worse solutions to escape local optima.
* **Local Beam Search**: A variation of beam search that keeps track of multiple states rather than just one, exploring several paths simultaneously.
* **Genetic Algorithms**: Mimicking natural selection, these algorithms use techniques like mutation, crossover, and selection to evolve solutions over generations.
* **Tabu Search**: A memory-based algorithm that avoids revisiting recently explored solutions, helping to escape local optima and explore new areas of the search space.
