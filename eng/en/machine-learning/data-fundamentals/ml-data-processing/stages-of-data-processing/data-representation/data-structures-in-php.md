* Integer
* Float
* String
* Boolean

#### 2.2 Compound Types

* Array
* Object

### 3. Arrays in PHP

#### 3.1 Indexed Arrays

* Definition and usage
* Creating and accessing indexed arrays
* Common operations (sorting, filtering, mapping)

#### 3.2 Associative Arrays

* Key-value pair structure
* Creating and manipulating associative arrays
* Use cases in data preparation

#### 3.3 Multidimensional Arrays

* Nested array structures
* Representing complex data hierarchies
* Techniques for traversing and manipulating multidimensional arrays

### 4. Objects and Classes

#### 4.1 Object-Oriented Programming in PHP

* Class definition and object instantiation
* Properties and methods
* Encapsulating data and behavior

#### 4.2 Standard PHP Library (SPL) Data Structures

* SplStack
* SplQueue
* SplHeap
* SplFixedArray

### 5. Specialized Data Structures

#### 5.1 Linked Lists

* Implementation in PHP
* Singly and doubly linked lists
* Use cases and performance considerations

#### 5.2 Trees

* Binary trees and their implementation
* Traversal algorithms

### 9. File Handling Structures

#### 9.1 File Pointers

* Opening, reading, and writing files
* Seeking and file pointer manipulation

#### 9.2 CSV Handling

* Reading and writing CSV files
* Parsing and generating structured data

### 10. Data Serialization and Storage

#### 10.1 Serialization Methods

* serialize() and unserialize() functions
* JSON encoding and decoding

#### 10.2 Persistent Storage

* Working with databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
* NoSQL options (MongoDB, Redis)

### 11. Memory Management in PHP
