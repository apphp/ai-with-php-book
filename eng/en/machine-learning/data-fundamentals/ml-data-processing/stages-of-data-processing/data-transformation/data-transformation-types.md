# Data Transformation Types

In Machine Learning, raw data rarely arrives in a form that is immediately suitable for modeling. Transforming data into a clean, consistent, and analyzable format is essential to ensure high model performance. This chapter discusses data transformation — a critical stage that reshapes and refines data, making it optimal for analysis and model training.

### Key Components of Data Transformation

1.  **Encoding Categorical Variables**\
    Machine learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on numerical computations, require categorical data to be represented in numerical form. Encoding techniques, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding, transform categories into numerical values that capture essential distinctions among them without introducing an unintended hierarchy.

    _Example_: Converting categories like "red," "blue," and "green" into a binary matrix (one-hot encoding) or unique integers (label encoding).
2.  **Normalizing and Scaling Numerical Features**\
    Numerical data, especially when values vary significantly, benefits from normalization or scaling. Normalization often rescales data to a range, such as 0 to 1, while standardization adjusts values to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. These transformations are essential for algorithms sensitive to input ranges, such as neural networks and distance-based methods (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors).

    _Example_: Normalizing income levels or ages to a 0–1 range ensures consistent value scales across variables, reducing model bias toward high-magnitude values.
3.  **Reshaping Data Structures**\
    For some models, data must be structured in specific ways. Time series data, for instance, often requires a sequential or tabular format with consistent intervals. Similarly, image data might need to be reshaped into multidimensional arrays to represent height, width, and color channels.

    _Example_: Reshaping a sequence of daily sales data into fixed-length windows allows a model to capture patterns over time.
4.  **Feature Engineering**\
    Feature engineering involves creating new variables or modifying existing ones to make data more informative for the model. This process may include deriving new attributes from existing data, such as calculating ratios, combining features, or extracting textual information into word embeddings for natural language processing tasks. Effective feature engineering often enhances a model’s ability to generalize and perform well.

    _Example_: Converting text data into word embeddings to represent each word’s contextual meaning or calculating the ratio of a product’s price to its category average to provide a relative price measure.

### Example Workflow of Data Transformation

Consider a dataset containing customer demographics and transaction history for a retail prediction model. The transformation process might include:

* **Encoding**: Converting customer categories (e.g., membership levels) into numerical labels.
* **Normalization**: Scaling transaction amounts to a consistent range.
* **Reshaping**: Structuring transaction data into a time-series format.
* **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features such as “average transaction frequency” to capture customer behavior.

### Conclusion

Data transformation is a foundational step in ML data processing. Through encoding, normalization, reshaping, and feature engineering, raw data is refined into an informative, usable structure. This transformation not only improves model performance but also supports interpretability, ensuring that patterns in the data are accessible and effectively utilized in model training.
