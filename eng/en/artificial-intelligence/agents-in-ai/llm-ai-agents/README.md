# LLM AI Agents

LLM AI agents are intelligent systems powered by large language models, capable of understanding natural language and performing tasks based on user input. These agents go beyond simple chatbots by integrating tools that allow them to interact with real-world applications, such as controlling smart home devices or retrieving data from APIs. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, LLM AI agents can make decisions, learn from past interactions, and adapt to user preferences over time.

For PHP developers, LLM agents open new possibilities for building AI-powered applications, from automated customer support to smart assistants. With the help of special PHP libraries, developers can quickly integrate AI agents into their projects without needing deep expertise in machine learning. In this section, weâ€™ll explore how LLM AI agents work, their key components, and how you can use them to enhance your PHP applications.
