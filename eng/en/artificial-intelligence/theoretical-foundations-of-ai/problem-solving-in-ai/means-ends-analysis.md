# Means-Ends Analysis



### **Relation of Adversarial Search to Means-Ends Analysis (MEA):**

### **Relation of Local Search to Means-Ends Analysis (MEA):**

While local search algorithms focus on optimizing states incrementally within a local space, **Means-Ends Analysis (MEA)** follows a different approach. MEA is not about optimizing states incrementally; instead, it reduces the difference between the current state and the goal state by breaking the problem into smaller subproblems. This makes MEA a more strategic and goal-directed approach, contrasting with the local, step-by-step optimization of local search algorithms.
