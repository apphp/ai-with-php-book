# Classification of NN Types

* by Architectures .... GAN?
* Overview of different architectures (e.g., feedforward, convolutional, recurrent).
* Suitable use cases for each type.
* forward / backward propagations !!!
* fully connected network / partially connected network
* by layers count&#x20;
* Spiking neural network !!!!!! vs normal (here or ) !!!!!!!
*   etc
