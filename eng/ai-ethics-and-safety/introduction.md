# Introduction

As artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into everyday applications, developers — especially those working with popular languages like PHP — are no longer just writing code. They're shaping how intelligent systems interact with people, influence decisions, and manage sensitive data. Whether you're building an AI-powered chatbot, a recommendation system, or a moderation tool, ethical considerations must be treated as essential parts of the development process.

In next chapters, we'll explore the ethical landscape surrounding AI in PHP-based web applications. You'll get a practical understanding of your responsibilities, the risks involved, and how you can take proactive steps to develop AI systems that are not just functional, but fair, respectful, and safe.
