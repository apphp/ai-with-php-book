# Practice

#### **Applying AI Ethics and Safety**

**1. Case Study Analysis**

* Analyze real-world examples of AI misuse (e.g., biased hiring algorithms, facial recognition controversies, misinformation spread).
* Identify ethical concerns and propose ways to mitigate them.
* Example cases:
  * **COMPAS Algorithm Bias in Criminal Justice**
  * **Amazonâ€™s AI Recruiting Bias Issue**

**2. Bias Detection in AI Models**

* Use an **AI dataset** and check for biases in training data.
* Apply fairness metrics using Python libraries (`Fairlearn`, `AIF360`).
* Compare model performance on different demographic groups.

**3. AI Privacy and Security Assessment**

* Conduct a **privacy audit** of an AI system:
  * What data is collected?
  * How is it stored and shared?
  * Are there compliance risks (GDPR, CCPA)?
* Simulate a **data breach scenario** and suggest mitigation steps.

**4. Ethical AI Decision-Making Scenarios**

* Provide **hypothetical dilemmas** where users must decide on AI-related ethical issues.
  * Should an AI system **prioritize fairness over accuracy**?
  * If an AI chatbot spreads **false information**, who is responsible?
  * Should an AI tool **explain its decisions** even if it makes it less effective?

**5. AI Governance and Policy Writing**

* Draft an **AI Ethics Policy** for a company adopting AI solutions.
* Include guidelines on bias reduction, transparency, and risk assessment.

**6. Hands-On AI Explainability Task**

* Take an AI model and **use explainability tools** (`SHAP`, `LIME`) to analyze why it makes certain decisions.
* Visualize decision-making patterns and discuss their ethical implications.
